# MSc Computer Science Independant Research Project: Machine-Learning

This project analyzed the precision of Random Forest, and XGBoost, in identifying students that had dropped out of a university in Portugal. Specifically, 1) investigated the modelsâ€™ suitability, 2) explored optimality with comparisons against Logistic Regression, and 3) interpreted the models using Shapley Additive Explanations(SHAP).
